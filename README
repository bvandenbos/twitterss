== Description

Twitterss is supposed to be a super simple, lightweight RSS => Twitter script
that can support multiple feeds to multiple Twitter accounts.  Since Twitter
is quickly becoming an SEO/marketing tool, it's common to find yourself
maintaining a lot of content from many different sources.  This allows your
app to only need to RSS and allow this script to manage the push to Twitter.


== Requirements

 * Ruby 1.8.6/7 (probably works with other versions but not tested)
 * rubygems
 * A handleful of gems
 * *nix or OSX.  Windows is not supported (though you might be able to get
   it to run on Windows).

== Usage

Twitterss is meant to be used as a cron job that runs however often.

   $ ./twitterss twitterrss.yml

== Configuration

Configuration is handled by a YAML file.  If you're unfamiliar with YAML look
here: http://www.yaml.org/.  Here's an example config file:

legalnews:
  rss: http://www.avvo.com/news.rss
  login: avvolegalnews
  password: secret

cnn_money_top_stories:
  rss: http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss
  login: money_news
  password: secret
  max: 5

cnn_money_markets:
  rss: http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_markets.rss
  login: money_news
  password: secret
  max: 3

This will tell twitterss maintain two twitter accounts.  Note that you can point
multiple RSS feeds at the same Twitter account if desired.  In this way you can 
have your Twitter feeds act as aggregators of multiple sources.  The default
value for 'max' is 5. 

== Notes

To keep track of posts that have already been sent to Twitter, Twitterrss needs
to maintain state.  Currently it does this by dumping a file to the home
directory of the user running the script (.twitterrss_history).
